In this study, we began by mapping epigenomic landscapes in isogenic endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells derived from one line of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).  We integrated transcriptomes, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and chromatin conformation to gain insight into the potential role of these epigenetic features and the coordination among them in gene regulation.  We then knocked down CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and RAD21, which are key regulators of chromatin conformation, to identify genes sensitive to chromatin folding.  Finally, we integrated the epigenomic data with genetic findings to nominate a noncoding SNP and used precise genome editing to identify the allelic effect of the SNP on gene expression and epigenetic features.
These findings provide novel insights into the global and genetic regulation of gene expression in human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells.  Our approach of integrating epigenomic mapping with targeted intervention and precise genome editing can be applied to study any cell types and traits.
